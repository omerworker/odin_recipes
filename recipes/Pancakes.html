        <h3>Description:</h3>
        <p>Perfect pancakes are easier to make than you think. This pancake recipe produces thick, fluffy, and all-around delicious pancakes with just a few ingredients that are probably already in your kitchen (and it's so much better than the boxed stuff).</p>
        <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Flour: This homemade pancake recipe starts with all-purpose flour.</li>
            <li>Baking powder: Baking powder, a leavener, is the secret to fluffy pancakes.</li>
            <li>Sugar: Just a tablespoon of white sugar is all you'll need for subtly sweet</li>
            <li>Salt: A pinch of salt will enhance the overall flavor without making your pancakes taste salty.</li>
            <li>Milk and butter: Milk and butter add moisture and richness to the pancakes.</li>
            <li>Egg: A whole egg lends even more moisture. Plus, it helps bind the pancake batter together.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Sift the dry ingredients together.</li>
            <li>Make a well, then add the wet ingredients. Stir to combine.</li>
            <li>Scoop the batter onto a hot griddle or pan.</li>
            <li>Cook for two to three minutes, then flip.</li>
            <li>Continue cooking until brown on both sides.</li>
        </ol>
